			<h1> Edinburgh Zoo Game </h1>

			<p>Myself and 7 others in a team delivered a prototype to a client at industry level. The multidisciplinary team was made up of two programmers, two designers and four artists. We were given a brief by RZSS (Royal Zoological Society of Scotland) to develop a game with the aim to educate S4-S6 pupils on the animal conservation efforts and breeding programs. This game was to be used specifically in an educational workshop at Edinburgh Zoo.</p>

			<p>As a team we took this brief all the way from concept to final build delivery at an industry level. This gave me an invaluable insight into the entire development cycle. We kept in regular communication with our client for feedback and gave updates as needed. We also met with our client in person during our formal presentation where we presented our findings post prototyping.</p>

			<p>I took the role of gameplay programmer during the project and had significant input specifically during the prototyping stage. I programmed systems and created my own concept art during this stage in order for the team to better conceptualize how the final product would look. After prototyping many different systems, myself and the designers worked closely to ensure the gameplay elements in the decided upon systems worked smoothly from a design perspective and were also fun to play. As programmer I was in charge of technical documentation and maintaining source control. Throughout development I worked closely with other disciplines in the team which ultimately led to the client being satisfied with the final build we delivered.</p>
